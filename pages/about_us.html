     <h1>About Us</h1> 

     <p>I am Cameron Harrington, and this is my first semester here at Shepherd University. I have a background in Cyber
      Security and have achieved an associateâ€™s degree from Blue Ridge Community and Technical College. I have completed
      one internship so far at The Clorox Company located in Martinsburg WV. After college my goal is to join the Air
      National Guard located in Martinsburg and specialize in cyber defense operations. My experience on web programming
      development has mainly come from a few classes I took at Blue Ridge. I have had a few software development classes
      which are similar. While taking these classes we would often work in lab simulations working on web development,
      learning new techniques and skillsets.</p>
    <p>I am Connor Smith, and I am a Senior at Shepherd University. My major is in Computer and Information Sciences
      with a concentration in Cyber Security and Networking. Currently, I have very little web programming experience,
      with most of my experience coming from what I have learned so far in CIS 332. However, I do have some experience
      with web scraping and using HTML sites in other projects which has given me some familiarity in viewing HTML code.
    </p>
    <p>I am Charles Moffat, and I am a Junior at Shepherd University. My major here at Shepherd is Computer and
      Information Sciences with a concentration in Cyber Security and Networking. I did not have much experience in web
      programming before taking this class, however the topic is very interesting, and I will continue to learn it
      outside of class. I have had multiple programming classes where I learned different languages which helps with
      learning the HTML and CSS structure and syntax. </p>
